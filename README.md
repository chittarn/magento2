How to enable the Digital Data layer
------------------------------------

The Digital Data Layer is enabled by default. If it has been disabled, follow these steps to re-enable it:

1. Log in to the Admin Panel
2. Navigate through Stores -> Configuration
3. On the left pane under "W3C Digital Data Layer", click on "Configuration"
4. On the right area, make sure that the box with heading "Digital Data Layer Configuration" is expanded
4. For "Enable Digital Data Layer" select "Yes"
5. The Digital Data Layer should now be enabled


Extensions to the Digital Data Layer standard
---------------------------------------------

This plugin adds the "availability" and "stockLevel" attribute to the official DDL standard productInfo object:

```javascript
window.digitalData.product = [];
window.digitalData.product.push({
    productInfo: {
        availability: 'in stock|out of stock',
        stockLevel: 32,
    },
    category:...
    price:...
    linkedProduct:...
});
```

Note that whether these two properties are output in the digitalData object is configured in the configuration
of this plugin, "Enable Stock Exposure". You can choose not to output any stock information, only availability
or stock level counts.
